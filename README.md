# Crypto Prices

This code fetches the top 10 cryptocurrency prices from the CoinMarketCap API, and displays them as a list of boxes containing the name and price of each currency. You can adjust the limit parameter in the API URL to get more or less currencies.

Note that this example only shows the price in USD, but you can modify the code to display prices in other currencies as well. Additionally, this example doesn't include any real-time updates, but you can add that functionality using techniques like polling or WebSockets.
